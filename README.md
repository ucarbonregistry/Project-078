# Project-078
2 MW Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Hamal Hydel Limited, Himachal Pradesh
The proposed project activity is promoted by M/S Hamal Hydel Limited (herein after called as project proponent ‘PP’). The proposed project activity is installation and operation of Francis Turbine with installed capacity of 2 MW in District - Shimla, Himachal Pradesh state of India. This project activity is also called as HAMAL (2 X 1MW) SHEP.

Country : India

State : Himachal Pradesh

District : Shimla

Village : Nakora

The project location is situated near village Nakora of Shimla district in the state of Himachal Pradesh. 
The Project site is about 123 kms from Shimla Airport. The geographic co-ordinate of the project 
location is 30°56' 08.6"N, 77°35' 54.4"E. 

The project activity aims to harness kinetic energy of water (renewable source) to generate electricity. 
The net generated electricity from the project activity is sold to state electricity board i.e., Himachal
Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed
between the Project Proponent (PP) and the utility. In pre-project scenario, electricity delivered to the 
grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of fossil fuel-based 
grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel-based generation sources in the 
grid. Currently, NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuel-based power plants.

The project activity is a grid connected renewable energy generation project having capacity 
of less than 15 MW. The project is a small-scale activity. The methodology applied in the 
Monitoring Report is verified against the A.M.S I. D “Grid connected renewable electricity 
generation” version 18.0
